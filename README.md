# What does the service do?
This is uses google api to return address of a place and its opening or closing time along with the contact number of that place if available. The place is accepted in a parameter called geo-city. This is integratd in a chat bot service called digibot. 

The service packs the result in the Api.ai webhook-compatible response JSON and returns it to Api.ai.
